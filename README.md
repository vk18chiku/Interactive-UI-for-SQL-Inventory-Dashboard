# Interactive UI for SQL Inventory Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Interactive UI for SQL Inventory Dashboard** is a live, interactive web-based dashboard built using **Streamlit** and **MySQL**.  
This project allows real-time inventory and supply chain management where any changes made through the dashboard are **immediately reflected in the MySQL database**.
